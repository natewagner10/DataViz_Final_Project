# DataViz_Final_Project
This repository consists of the code behind our Final project fo Data Visualization course consisting of a Shiny Dashboard visualizing aggregated Covid-19 timeseries data from the New York Times.

The contributors to this project are Manda Bucklin, Nate Wagner, Dominic Ventura, and Ashley Brockway. 

## Description of Approach 

Our focus was to cleanly visualize raw data trends over multiple locational dimensions. These dimensions include: state level (a map of Florida with county boundaries), individual Florida Counties, groups of Florida Counties, and global data across countries.
